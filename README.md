# Destroid

A space shooter based on the classic Asteroids, written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).

##### Play it at [blackbrane.github.io/destroid/](http://blackbrane.github.io/destroid/)

Destroid places stronger emphasis on the compactness property of space that was utilized in Asteroids and other games â€“ i.e. the fact that when traveling off in some direction you eventually reemerge on "the other side". Unlike in Asteroids, the player's view extends beyond the size of the space so that this compactness is visually apparent: The player sees "additional copies" of their ship and other physical bodies when sufficiently close to the boundaries of the screen.

#### Controls

* Space bar = shoot / begin
* Up-arrow = accelerate
* Left/Right-arrows = rotate
