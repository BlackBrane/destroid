# Destroid
An in-progress space shooter based on the classic Asteroids, written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). This is essentially an early demo as only flying, shooting and basic infrastructure are yet in place.

Destroid places stronger emphasizes on the compactness property of space that was utilized in Asteroids and other games â€“ i.e. the fact that when traveling off in some direction you eventually reemerge on "the other side". Unlike in Asteroids, the player's view extends beyond the compactification length scale so that the continuity of space is visually apparent. The player sees "additional copies" of their ship and other physical bodies when sufficiently close to the boundaries of the screen.
